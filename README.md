Smarthome controller with ESP32 and ESPHOME

This repository is for a smart home controller based on an ESP32 with using ESPHOME


Why this project?

I wanted an SMarthome controller with which I can control my lights and shutters in my house. The controllers are installed centrally in the switch cabinet.

The controller is based on an ESP32 with ESPHOME

# How it works

The controllers are preferably housed in the fuse box in the electrical installation and communicate with the control centre via the LAN network. They have 12 outputs for switching lights and roller shutter motors. There are 12 inputs for light push-buttons and roller shutter push-buttons. The controllers function without a PC and accept switching and movement commands for lights and roller shutters

# Cost

The cost of a controller is about 60 euros
